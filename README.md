Created a simple customer registration example using Jsp, Servlet, Jdbc in eclipse and tomcat. 
**Steps implemented -**
Created a registration form using jsp. 
On submitting the form, control goes to a servlet. 
The servlet calls the dao class function, that further communicates with the mysql database using jdbc. 
And the user registration data is inserted into the database.
